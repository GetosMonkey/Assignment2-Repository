CSC2001F 2025 Data Structures Assignment 2 Instructions The goal of this assignment is to test the performance of the AVL Tree to determine if AVL trees really do balance nodes and provide good performance irrespective of the size of the data.

Today I basically just finished the AVL tree implementation as an edited version of my BinaryTree class from last week so it remains balanced  through rotation logic.

## 25 March 2025

I completed the program more or less today, essentially just reusing my code from last week again but tweaking it so that it lists all the terms in a given search and outputs it to a file. But since the project requires it I'll also use output redirection in UNIX to save the output of each run to a file.
